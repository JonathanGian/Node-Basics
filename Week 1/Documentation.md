### HTTP headers
Message headers are used to send metadata about a resource or a HTTP message, and to describe the behavior of the client or the server.

### HTTP request methods
Request methods indicate the purpose of the request and what is expected if the request is successful. The most common methods are GET and POST for retrieving and sending data to servers, respectively, but there are other methods which serve different purposes.
